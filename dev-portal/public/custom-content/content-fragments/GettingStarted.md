### Create an account and subscribe to APIs

To use any of our APIs you must create a developer account. A developer account provides an API Key for accessing our APIs, a playground for testing our APIs, and API usage metrics. Create or sign in using the buttons in the top right.

After you create a new account, you will have a new API Key but it won't be linked to any of our APIs. To activate it for a particular API, navigate to [APIs](/apis) and find the API you want. Click `subscribe`. Your API Key is now subscribed to the API and you can make calls to its methods.

If you need your API Key for any reason, you can always find it on [your dashboard](/dashboard) after logging in.
